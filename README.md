Generates a 5e Dungeons and Dragons character

This project comes from my love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted a quick way to generate some random character stats to get ideas flowing for players wanting to make a character.So I built this!
It has a bare-bones single-page design. I mimicked the look of a Dungeon and Dragons character sheet.
