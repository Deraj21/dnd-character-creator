**Generates a 5e Dungeons and Dragons character**

This project comes from my love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted a quick way to generate some random character stats to get ideas flowing for players wanting to make a character. So I built this!
It has a bare-bones single-page design. I mimicked the look of a Dungeon and Dragons character sheet.I  picked up a few css tricks, and go to know css more intimately while working on this website. I hope you enjoy.

## Laundry list of Future Plans
- [ ] Find a better D&D api that uses https
- [ ] Style a little more tightly
  - [ ] Stretch out small abilities (such as proficiency bonus)
  - [ ] Attack table column labels the correct text-size
  - [ ] Lines in lists go all the way to the end of the box
  - [ ] Double column text box displays nicely
  - [ ] List content goes to next line when too long to fit
  - [ ] Padding around 'Dungeons & Drragons' title
  - [ ] lighter gray color for gray boxes?
- [x] Add screenshots
- [ ] Editable fields for abilities, race, etc. (not just random generation)
- [ ] Create pages 2 and 3
