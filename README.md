**Generates a 5e Dungeons and Dragons character**

This project comes from my love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted a quick way to generate some random character stats to get ideas flowing for players wanting to make a character. So I built this!
It has a bare-bones single-page design. I mimicked the look of a Dungeon and Dragons character sheet.I  picked up a few css tricks, and go to know css more intimately while working on this website. I hope you enjoy.

This site is hosted [here](https://deraj21.github.io/dnd-character-creator) via github-pages.
